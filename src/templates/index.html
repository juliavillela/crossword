    <p>Generate a custom crossword puzzle from your own list of words.</p>
    <a class="btn btn-primary mb-3" href="create"> create puzzle</a>
    <h3>how it works</h3>
    <p>Given your input, crossword generator will give you two images to download: 
        a <b>puzzle key</b>, that contains the placement of each letter and, of course, 
        a numbered <b>blank puzzle</b> that you can give to somebody else to solve</p>
    <p><b>puzzle key:</b></p>
    <div class="mb-3"  style="
    max-width: 500px;
    contain: content; ">
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='assets/key.png') }}" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
    </div>
    <p>the puzzle above was generated from the words</p>
    <ul>
        <li>pickthewords</li>
        <li>puzzle</li>
        <li>custom</li>
        <li>generate</li>
        <li>buildyourown</li>
        <li>crossword</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>blank puzzle:</b></p>
    <div class="mb-3"  style="
    max-width: 500px;
    contain: content; ">
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='assets/blank.png') }}" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
    </div>
    <p> You can regenerate the puzzle as many times as you want from a same list of words until you find a configuration that you like.
        However, keep in mind that some set of words will have more possible combinations than others.
    </p>
